Here you will find scripts and documentation for the Raspberry Pi-thon Workshop presented at Pearl Hack 2019 at UNC-Chapel Hill. The workshop covers the basics of I2C and GPIO, Raspberry Pi setup, and basic python scripting using the Pimoroni Touch pHAT Library.

Check out the [Wiki section](https://github.com/CallieLinux/RaspberryPi-thon/wiki) for a walkthrough of the workshop.

## Required Software

You will need drivers to use the console cable that allows you to connect to the Raspberry Pi from your computer. Download the drivers specific to your operating system:

### Mac

See [Mac Software Installation Instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable/software-installation-mac) for more details but the necessary downloads are listed here:
- SiLabs Drivers: http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/Mac_OSX_VCP_Driver.zip

### Windows

See [Windows Software Installation Instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable/software-installation-windows]) for more details but the necessary downloads are listed here:
- PuTTY: http://www.putty.org/
- SiLabs Drivers: http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/CP210x_Windows_Drivers.zip

### Linux

Most Debian-based Linux flavors should have `screen` installed. Run `screen -v` to check if you already have `screen` installed. Use your OS's package manager to install screen if needed (e.g. `sudo apt-get install screen`)

See [Linux Software Installation Instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable/software-installation-linux) for more details.
